        <h2>CONCEPT & GAMEPLAY</h2>

        <p>Each player represents a hiker along a nature trail, starting out with a canteen, 1 stone, 1 leaf, and 1 acorn. Throughout the game, each hiker moves back and forth from the trail head to the trail end and back, collecting resources, badges, and photos along the way, increasing their score with each photo collected and badge earned (collecting badges does not increase your score, but purchasing (i.e. earning) them with your resources does). On each tile of the board, you have a different outcome, given by the images on them:
<br>
          Stone tile: hiker collects a stone resource
          <br>
          Leaf tile: hiker collects a leaf resource
          <br>
          Acorn tile: Hiker collects an acorn resource
          <br> 
          Dice tile: Hiker clicks 'Roll Dice' button and recieves a random outcome given onscreen
          <br>
          Camera tile: Hiker reveals a new photo for their collection
        </p>

        <p>
          Each time a hiker visits the trail end or trail head, the sun sets further (i.e. moves towards the origin [trail head] by 1 space). Gameplay ends when the sun reaches its original position at the trail head.</p
        >

        <p>Hikers can use their canteen resource to move 2 spaces at once in a single turn, instead of moving 1 space. This can help trigger end game quicker as to sabotage the other player in getting more points than you, or from reaching another badge spot before game end. </p>

        <p>
          You win by having the most points at the end through collecting photos and badges throughout the game.</p
